Report Date: 21 April 2026

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Description
Survey App is a full-stack PERN web platform for secure user onboarding, survey publishing and response collection, analytics visibility, content delivery (articles/media/training), consulting lead capture, and admin operations.

### 1.2 Purpose of This Document
This report provides formal evidence of manual testing and validation completed against the deployed application. It captures scope, execution method, traceability, observed outcomes, and issue status for release assurance and operational confidence.

### 8.1 Non-Blocking Issue Summary

|---|---|---|---|---|
| NB-01 | TC-ADM-002 | Analytics period chip highlight did not update on first switch in one observed run | Low | Non-blocking; analytics data still refreshed correctly |
| NB-02 | TC-UI-002 | Minor text/CTA overlap on narrow mobile width in consulting hero section | Low | Non-blocking; CTA remained accessible |
| NB-03 | TC-PERF-001 | Noticeable initial thumbnail render delay on mobile data in media feed | Low | Non-blocking; page remained usable |

## 9. Tools Used

- Postman for API request and response verification
- Chrome DevTools for network/console inspection and viewport testing
- Manual test execution log for case-by-case outcome tracking

## 10. Performance Observations (Qualitative)

- Core pages (login, surveys list, survey detail, dashboard) loaded without noticeable delay impacting basic navigation or interaction on desktop browsers.
- On mobile data, initial media feed thumbnail rendering showed a visible delay during first load, while text content appeared earlier.
- No complete UI freeze or hard navigation failure was observed during performance-focused manual checks.
- Performance evaluation in this cycle was observational and tool-assisted; no benchmark-grade timing dataset was collected.

## 11. Limitations

- Testing was manual and scenario-based; no automated regression suite was executed.
- Observed behavior reflects sampled sessions across selected browsers/devices, not exhaustive device coverage.
- Performance assessment was qualitative; no controlled load test campaign was performed.
- Security verification was limited to application-level checks and did not include external penetration testing.

## 12. Conclusion

The deployed Survey App demonstrates stable behavior across core functional flows, role-based access control, validation handling, and primary content/consulting workflows within the defined test scope.

Observed non-blocking issues are documented for future refinement and do not impact core system usability.
